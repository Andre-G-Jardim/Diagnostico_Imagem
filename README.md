  Brain Tumor Detection via Convolutional Neural Networks: A Comparative Approach of Networks With and Without Pre-Training
</h2>
<p align="justify">
  <strong>Abstract â€”</strong> In the human being, as new cells, cells will be replaced, being replaced by new cells. If there is an unforeseen event and a cell is born before the death of its predecessor, new cells proliferate on top of the old ones and, with that, a mass of tissue called a tumor appears. If this tumor mass develops in the brain, it is called a brain tumor or intracranial tumor.
Manually diagnosing the disease requires a radiologist to take an image and then a specialist physician is hired for imaging and treatment planning. Unfortunately, studies investigating the accuracy of manual brain tumor diagnosis report disagreement among expert reviewers. Maximum agreement among experts for the manual diagnosis of brain tumor is reported to be between 90% and 95%. For mixed tumor, mixed glioma, and medullary blastoma categories, expert disagreement further declines to 77% and 58%, respectively (3).
However, nowadays, the use of convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms has become a viable possibility when it comes to processing.
Therefore, this article seeks to bring an implementation of a CNN network that can improve the results of correct diagnosis as a decision support system.

  This study uses the dataset "Br35H :: Detection of Brain Tumors 2020", obtained from the Kaggle.com platform, as the primary source of information. The dataset contains a variety of brain tumor images that were used to train and evaluate the performance of the convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm proposed in this paper.
